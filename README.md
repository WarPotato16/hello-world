# hello-world
This repository contains a program to print the phrase "Hello World" to the console.

Just to introduce myself, my name is Alexander Bousman and I'm the author of this "hello-world" repository. I'm a student at The Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities, and I've made this repository for Assignment 5 of my CS 222 class at Ball State University. Enjoy!
